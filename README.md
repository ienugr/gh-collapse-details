# Collapse GitHub Details Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension adds a "Collapse Details" button to GitHub Pull Request (PR) pages. When clicked, it collapses all open `<details>` tags in the PR comments, making it easier to navigate and read through large discussions.

## Features

- **Simple and Effective**: Just a single button added to the GitHub PR page that collapses all open `<details>` elements.
- **GitHub-Styled Button**: The button blends in with the GitHub UI, making it look native to the platform.
